exports[`Running a scenario Scenario missing a step 1`] = `
"Scenario \\"Doing some stuff\\" has 3 step(s) in the feature file, but 2 step definition(s) defined. Try adding the following code:

test('Doing some stuff', ({ given, when, then }) => {
	given('I did some stuff', () => {

	});

	when('I do some stuff', () => {

	});

	then('I should have done some stuff', () => {

	});
});

Expected step #3 in scenario \\"Doing some stuff\\" to match \\"I should have done some stuff\\". Try adding the following code:

then('I should have done some stuff', () => {

});"
